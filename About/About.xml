--- Original Description ---
	
Now Updated for the full release of rimworld

Are you Tired of watching your pawns battle it out with those raiders by shooting each other but are completely quiet like if they're in an nerf battle?
Worry no longer!
introducing A Custom modifed made Mod that adds pain and death sounds to most pawns.
Now Your battles will sound Realistic. And Painful.
Most sounds are from the Battlefield series and rising storm 2.
Note that there are no seperate sound files for FEMALE pawns in this mod.
Unless someone can help find the code line that Triggers and targets female pawns only.
mod only adds;
Pain and Death sounds for human pawns.</description>
